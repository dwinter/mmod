This is a short demo of \texttt{mmod} library for differentiation statistics in R.
As an example, we are going to examine the \texttt{nancycats} data that comes
with \texttt{adegenet}. This dataset contains microsattelite genotypes
taken from feral cats in Nancy, France.
So let's start.

<<start>>=
library(mmod)
data(nancycats)
nancycats
@
\newpage
The nancycats data comes in \texttt{adegenet}'s default class for genotypic
data, the \texttt{genind} class. The functions in \texttt{mmod} work on genind
 objects, so you would usually start by reading in your data using
 \texttt{read.genepop}
 
 
Now that we have our data on hand, our goal is to see

\begin{itemize}
        \item Whether this population is substantially differentiated into
        smaller sub-populations
        \item Whether such differentiation can be explain by the geographical
        distance between sub-populations.
\end{itemize}


We can look at several statistics to ask answer the first question by using
 the \verb+diff_stats()+ function:

<<diffstat>>=
diff_stats(nancycats)
@

OK, so what's all that then? The first table has statistics calculated individually
for each locus in the dataset. \texttt{Hs} and \texttt{Ht} are estimates of the
heterozygosity expected for this population with and without the sub-populations
defined in the \texttt{nancycats} data respectively. We need to use those to
calculate the measures of population divergence so we might as well display
them at the same time. \texttt{Gst} is the standard (Nei) $G_\text{ST}$,
\verb+Gprime_st+ is Hedrick's $G''_\text{ST}$ and \texttt{D} is Jost's $d_\text{EST}$.
Because all of these statistics are estimated from estimators of \texttt{Hs}
and \texttt{Ht}, it's possible to get negative values for each of these
differentiation measures. Populations can't be negatively differentiated, so
you should think of these as estimates of a number close to zero (it's up to
you and your reviewers to decided to report the negative numbers of just
zeros).
 
$d_\text{EST}$ is the easiest statistic to interpret, as you expect to
find $D=0$ for populations with no differentiation and $D=1$ for completely
differentiated populations. As you can see, different loci give quite
different estimates of divergence but they range from $\sim$0.1--0.4.
\newpage
You might also want to see how regular old $G_\text{ST}$ compares with
with $D$ (Figure 1):

<<label=fig1plot>>=
nc.diff_stats <- diff_stats(nancycats)
with(nc.diff_stats,
plot(per.locus[,"Gst"], per.locus[,"D"], xlab="Gst", ylab="D"))
fit <- with(nc.diff_stats, (lm(per.locus[,"D"] ~ per.locus[,"Gst"])))
abline(fit)
@
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
<<label=fig1, fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
<<fig1plot>>
@
\end{center}
\label{Gst v D}
\caption{Nei's $G_\text{ST}$ against Jost's $D$}
\end{figure}

The second part of the list returned by \verb+diff_stat+ contains global
estimates of each of these statistics. For $G_\text{ST}$ and $G''_\text{ST}$ these are
based on the average of \texttt{Hs} and \texttt{Ht} across loci. For
$D_\text{EST}$ you get two, the harmonic mean of the $D_\text{EST}$ for each locus and,
because that method won't work if you end up with negative estimates of $D_\text{EST}$,
one calculated as per $G_\text{ST}$ and $G''_\text{ST}$.
\newpage
You probably want to have some idea of how robust this result is. \texttt{mmod} has a
few functions for performing bootstrap samples of \texttt{genind} objects and
calculating statistics from those samples. Because some of these functions can
take a long time to run, let's create a whopping great 10 repetition bootstrap
sample of the \texttt{nancycats} data, then calculate $d_\text{EST}$ from that sample:
<<bs>>=
bs <- chao_bootstrap(nancycats, nreps=10)
bs.D <- summarise_bootsrap(bs, D_Jost)
bs.D
@
As you can see, printing a summarised bootstrap sample gives us shows a basic
overview of that data, but there is also quite a lot more there --- use
\texttt{str(bs.D)} or the classic \texttt{bs.D\$} [tab tab] to check it out. I don't
think there is much point trying to interpret confidence intervals estimated
from 10 samples, but the point estimates seem to show a population with some
substantial differentiation.
\newpage
Next, we want to know if geography can explain that differentiation.
The nancycats data comes with coordinates for each populations. We can use
these to get Euclidean distances:

<<label=show_coords>>=
head(nancycats@other$xy, 4)
nc.pop_dists <- dist(nancycats@other$xy, method="euclidean")
@

\texttt{mmod} provides functions to calculate pairwise versions of each of
the differentiation statistics. Because we want to perform a Mantel test, we'll
use the ``linearized'' version of $D$, which is just $x/(1-x)$ (each of the
pairwise stats has and argument to return this version).

<<label=pw>>=
nc.pw_D <- pairwise_D(nancycats, linearized=TRUE)
@

The library \texttt{ade4}, which is loaded with \texttt{mmod}, provides
functions to perform Mantel tests on distance matrices.

<<label=mantel>>=
mantel.rtest(nc.pw_D, log(nc.pop_dists), 999)
@

So, the geographic distance between these populations can't explain the
genetic divergences we see: the correlation is small and non-significant.
If you like, we can also visualize this relationship for each statistic
(Figure~\ref{GstvD}).

<<label=fig2plot>>=
fit <- lm(as.vector(nc.pw_D) ~ as.vector(nc.pop_dists))
plot(as.vector(nc.pop_dists), as.vector(nc.pw_D),
     ylab="pairwise D", xlab="physical distance")
abline(fit)
@
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
<<label=fig2, fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
<<fig2plot>>
@
\end{center}
\caption{Geographic distance does not explain genetic differentiation}
\label{GstvD}
\end{figure}

There are a couple of other functions that are not used here, use
\texttt{help(package="mmod")} to read about them.
